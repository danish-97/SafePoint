SafePoint

SENG202 Team 3

This is the first version of SafePoint.
Functionality at this point includes: Viewing Crime Data from a file, adding custom Crime Data, viewing this data on a map, filtering by crime type, date, arrests made, user/police data, and filtering by highest/lowest number of crime types, and lowest/highest crime areas.

We have had a lot of problem with JavaFX and have asked tutors for help, but so far we haven't found a solution. This means that the program builds on some computers and not others, and a jar file is currently not obtainable.

We also have some issues with our pipeline, where the tests work on all our home machines, but fail on the pipeline. The issues we have seen on the pipeline we are unable to reproduce at this stage.

To run this version of the program in IntelliJ, you may need to go into the Maven tab -> Plugins -> compiler -> compiler: compile, then Plugins -> javafx -> javafx: run
